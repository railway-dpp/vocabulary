# Description data model
Note: Class descriptions are aligned to the DPP System Standard (link follows) semantic/functional model (data model, product property and information product structures, transactional timestamps, dictionary/units, stakeholders, and EU DPP Registry). Rail-specific acceptance/mechanical context for steel grades references EN 13674-1. Inline citations point to attached files and pages.

*Note: All classes receive per default an id provided by json ld context "@id". Therefore class id's are not listet in following vocabulary. 

## ProductGroup
Groups rail products that share essential technical characteristics (e.g., railProfile and steelGrade) so they can be managed and assessed consistently within a DPP. In the DPP System Standard (link follows) model, such characteristics are represented as product properties in a Product property collection; related certificates and documents are modeled as information products DPP System Standard (link follows). Steel grade-related acceptance and mechanical conformity are validated via tensile strength/elongation testing procedures (predictive equations, periodic tests, corrective actions) in EN 13674-1 (Schinene Norm EN 13674-1.pdf, 19).
