    comment: >
      Groups rail products that share essential technical characteristics
      (such as rail profile and steel grade) so they can be managed and assessed
      consistently within a Digital Product Passport. In the DPP System Standard
      semantic model, such characteristics are represented as product properties
      within a Product Property Collection, while related certificates and
      documents are modeled as information products. Steel grade-related
      acceptance and mechanical conformity are validated through tensile
      strength and elongation testing procedures defined in EN 13674-1.

    label: Transport
    comment: >
      Models a transport credential subject capturing responsible service
      provider, time-bound movement data, and environmental impact metrics.
      Transport aligns with the transactional model’s business steps (e.g.,
      shipping) and event times, and service providers are represented as
      stakeholder roles within the DPP ecosystem.
    upper_value: cred:CredentialSubject

  - id: ModeOfTransport
    label: ModeOfTransport
    comment: >
      A credential with one or more modes of vehicles used to fullfill transport order. 
      E.g electrical engine, benzin lorry, diesel ship...) On each mode an EPD Environmental
      Product Decleration can be callculated.

  - id: TransportBatch
    label: Transport Batch
    comment: >
      Represents a shipment batch aggregating one or more transport events for
      a given DPP. It captures origin and destination to support traceability
      across movements and aligns with the data model’s identification pattern
      for data elements.

    label: Digital Product Passport
    comment: >
      The Digital Product Passport acts as the digital container for product
      metadata, product properties, and lifecycle-related information.
      Core metadata includes identifiers, product name, granularity, and
      facility references, while properties such as length and weight are
      modeled as data elements with controlled units.

  - id: EUDPPRegistry
    label: EU DPP Registry
    comment: >
      Represents the EU Digital Product Passport Registry, where DPPs are
      registered to support discovery, conformity assessment, and market
      surveillance. Registration is an interoperability-relevant moment and a
      responsibility of economic operators.

  - id: DppSchema
    label: DPP Schema
    comment: >
      Captures the schema or profile used by DPP instances. In the DPP System
      Standard model, schemas reference open repositories containing property
      templates, standards, and controlled units, while data elements carry
      dictionary references.

  - id: DoPC
    label: Declaration of Product Conformity
    comment: >
      Declaration of Product Conformity modeled as a credential subject. In the
      DPP semantic model, such declarations are treated as information products
      with metadata (issuer, issue date) and references to applicable standards.
